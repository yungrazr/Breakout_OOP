#Breakout Game

This is my second assignment project for OOP Year2, made in Processing.
It is a simple breakout game with five different levels and five various powerups.

It consists of a main menu, controls menu (which explains how to play and what each of the powerups do), level select, play screen & game over screen.

The levels are read in from text files in the /data folder, where # is an empty space and the @ symbol is a brick. 
It is therefore somewhat easy to create new levels or modifying existing ones by just changing some symbols in the text file.

There are 5 powerups, 'Size+' which increases paddle size, 'Size-' which decreases paddle size (best to avoid), 'Slow' which slows down the ball, 'Speed' which speeds up the ball, & '1UP' which gives you and extra life.
